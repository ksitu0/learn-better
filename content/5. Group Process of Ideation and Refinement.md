Our group process of developing a new structure for INTEG 120 followed the design thinking process
  
**![[Screen Shot 2023-11-26 at 6.59.51 PM.png]]

**Step 1: Empathize with the user** — sharing our stories
- Individual experiences
- Group connection (similarities, challenges)
- **master list of successes and weaknesses in our three offerings**
- considered how the Prof teaching it 
- current student's experiences with the course (Marcus is TA - talked to students)

**Step 2:** **Define the problem** — organizing information
- Separate experiences --> common themes
- Identified:
	- learning objectives of the course
	- common successes—PKM
	- areas in need of improvement 
		1. Deliverables
		2. Content
		3. Engagement/participation

**Step 3:** **Ideate solutions** — interventions 
- Split into subgroups: problem def & intervention 
- A LOT of info --> how cut down/identify what our focus was

**Step 4: Prototype solutions** - narrowing scope
- Created "presentation doc"
- Individuals assigned to subgroups --> applied what worked on in subgroups to presentation 

**Step 5**: **Test solution** - presentation 
- Clear message to audience?
- Hope redesign considered by the instructor and tested in future offering
