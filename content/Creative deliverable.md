**Skill Development Project** 

**> Top level Bloom’s Taxonomy: *create*, combine, & test out learning strategies that learned in the course 
	
Possible Examples: 
- combining learning strategies
- create new strategies or discover/research strategies not introduced in class

Objectives:
- **Personalizable** project 
	- Connection: Week 10 Reading: breaking out of rituals  
- **Implement** learning strategies
	- Not just reflect/theorize about them but actually *practice* them

Logistics for project:
- Month-long final project
- Individual or in groups
- Any medium of presentation (but not too difficult for TAs)
- PKM integration: 
	- OUR Different experiences of taking INTEG120
	- Enjoyed PKM System --> incorporate into creative deliverable 
		- Add new learning strategies as atomic notes → new concepts for PKM!
		- Take strategies from PKM → make their own

- Strand 1: generating ideas for learning plans based on course content
    
- Strand 2: combining ideas and trying them out
    
- Strand 3: evaluating strategies to find the right one
    

Timeline
1. Choose learning strategies 
2. Regular checkpoints: low-effort snapshots of skill development progress
3. Construct deliverable: conclusions on your innovations in learning strategies
	- What did you learn from this project?
    

Summary - Skill development Project:
- help students learn and understand learning strategies in 120
