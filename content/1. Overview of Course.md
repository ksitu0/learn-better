**Calendar description**

This course introduces students to state-of-the-art scientific research on learning and cognitive adaptability. There are two learning objectives in this course. First, you will learn about how the mind processes information, and will begin developing new habits to facilitate clear and critical thinking in complex, messy, and stressful circumstances. Second, you will learn how to see the social networks you are embedded in, and how they shape what you think, know, and do. You will use this knowledge to identify opportunities and develop strategies for learning, and for the integration and synthesis of different types of knowledge.

Supplementary description (F22)

This is an introductory and interdisciplinary course on learning designed to help you become a more effective and efficient learner. You will learn about several influential theories of cognition, practice evidence-based learning strategies, and experiment with several approaches to personal knowledge management and knowledge integration. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and skills necessary for taking more control of your own learning (and unlearning) in all aspects of your life, not just in university.
